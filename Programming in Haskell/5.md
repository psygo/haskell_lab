# List Comprehensions

In mathematics, the *comprehension* notation can be used to construct new sets from existing sets.

The symbol `|` is read as *such that*, `<-` is read as is *drawn from*, and the expression `x <- [1..5]` is called a *generator*.

List comprehensions can also use logical expressions called *guards* to filter the values produced by earlier generators.

## The `zip` function

The library function `zip` produces a new list by pairing successive elements from two existing lists until either or both lists are exhausted.

```hs
> zip [’a’,’b’,’c’] [1,2,3,4]
[(’a’,1),(’b’,2),(’c’,3)]
```

> The term comprehension comes from the axiom of comprehension in set theory.
