# First Steps

- Function application has higher priority than all other operators in the language.
- For example, if you wish to use vim you would enter :set editor vim. The command :type is explained in more detail in the next chapter.
- If desired, such grouping can be made explicit by enclosing a sequence of definitions in curly parentheses and separating each definition by a semi-colon.
- Haskell assumes that tab stops are 8 characters wide.
- Nested comments begin and end with the symbols ``{-`` and ``-}``.
