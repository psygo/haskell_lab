# Interactive Programming

In the early days of computing, most programs were batch programs that were run in isolation from their users, to maximise the amount of time the computer was performing useful work.

Hence, given a suitable type World whose values represent states of the world, the notion of an interactive program can be represented by a function of type World -> World, which we abbreviate as IO (short for input/output) using the following type declaration:

```hs
type IO = World -> World

-- Generalizing:
type IO a = World -> (a,World)
```

Expressions of type `IO a` are called actions. 

In addition to returning a result value, interactive programs may also requireargument values. However, there is no need to generalise the IO type furtherto take account of this, because this behaviour can already be achieved by ex-ploiting currying. For example, an interactive program that takes a characterand returns an integer would have type Char -> IO Int, which abbreviates the curried function type Char -> World -> (Int,World).

## Basic Actions

The function return provides a bridge from pure expressions without side effects to impure actions with side effects.

```hs
return :: a -> IO a
return v = ...
```

## Sequencing

```hs
do v1 <- a1
   v2 <- a2
   .
   .
   .
   vn <- an
   return (f v1 v2 ... vn)
```

- As with list comprehensions, the expressions `vi <- ai` are called generators, because they generatevalues for the variables vi.
- If the result value produced by a generator `vi <- ai` is not required, the generator can be abbreviated simply by ai,which has the same meaning as writing `_ <- ai`.

For example, an action that reads three characters, discards the second, and returns the first and third as a pair can now be defined as follows:

```hs
act :: IO (Char,Char)
act = do x <- getChar
         getChar
         y <- getChar
         return (x,y)
```
```hs
getLine :: IO String
getLine = do x <- getChar
             if x == '\n' then
                return []
             else
                do xs <- getLine
                   return (x:xs)
```
