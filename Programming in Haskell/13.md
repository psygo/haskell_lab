# Monadic Parsing

A parser is a program that takes a string of characters as input, and produces some form of tree that makes the syntactic structure of the string explicit.

The key difference is thata parser also has the possibility to fail by returning a list of results, whereas astate transformer always returns a single result. In this manner, a parser can be viewed as a generalised form of state transformer.

## Making Choices

Making a choice between two alternatives isnâ€™t specific to parsers, but can be generalised to a range of applicative types. This concept is captured by the following class declaration in the library Control.Applicative:

```hs
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
   empty :: f a
   (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
```
