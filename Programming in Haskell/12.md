## Functors

More generally, the idea of mapping a function over each element of a datastructure isnâ€™t specific to the type of lists, but can be abstracted further to a widerange of parameterised types. The class of types that support such a mappingfunction are called functors. In Haskell, this concept is captured by the following class declaration in the standard prelude:

```hs
class Functor f where
   fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

That is, for a parameterised type f to be an instance of the class Functor, it must support a function fmap of the specified type. The intuition is that fmaptakes a function of type a -> b and a structure of type f a whose elements havetype a, and applies the function to each such element to give a structure of typef b whose elements now have type b. The fact that f must be a parameterisedtype, that is, a type that takes another type as a parameter, is determinedautomatically during type inference by virtue of the application of f to the types a and b in the specified type for fmap in the class declaration.

### Examples

As we would expect, the type of lists can be made into a functor by simply
defining fmap to be the function map:

```hs
instance Functor [] where
   -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
   fmap = map

instance Functor Maybe where
   -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
   fmap _ Nothing = Nothing
   fmap g (Just x) = Just (g x)
```

However, not all instances fit this pattern. For example,
the IO type is not a container type in the normal sense of the term because its
values represent input/output actions whose internal structure we do not have
access to, but it can readily be made into a functor:

```hs
instance Functor IO where
   -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> IO a -> IO b
   fmap g mx = do {x <- mx; return (g x)}
```

**The main benefits**:

- The function fmap can be used to process the elements of any structure that is functorial. That is, we can use the same name for functions that are essentially the same, rather than having to invent a separate name for each instance.
- We can define generic functions that can be used with any functor. For example, our earlier function that increments each integer in a list can be generalised to any functorial type by simply using fmap rather than map:

```hs
inc :: Functor f => f Int -> f Int
inc = fmap (+1)

> inc (Just 1)
Just 2

> inc [1,2,3,4,5]
[2,3,4,5,6]

> inc (Node (Leaf 1) (Leaf 2))
Node (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3)
```

## Functor Laws

The 2 laws:

```hs
fmap id      = id
fmap (g . h) = fmap g . fmap h
```

Note,however, that the two occurrences of id in this equation have different types: on the left-hand side id has type a -> a and hence fmap id has type f a -> f a,which means that the id on the right-hand side must also have type f a -> f a in order for the equation to be well-typed.

We will see how to formally prove such properties when we consider tech-niques for reasoning about programs in chapter 16. In fact, for any parameterisedtype in Haskell, there is at most one function fmap that satisfies the requiredlaws. That is, if it is possible to make a given parameterised type into a functor,there is only one way to achieve this. Hence, the instances that we defined for lists, Maybe, Tree and IO were all uniquely determined.

## Applicatives

Suppose now that we wish to generalise this idea to allow functions with any
number of arguments to be mapped, rather than being restricted to functions
with a single argument.

```hs
fmap0 :: a -> f a
fmap1 :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
fmap2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
fmap3 :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> f a -> f b -> f c -> f d
```
