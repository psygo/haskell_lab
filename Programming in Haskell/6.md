# Recursive Functions

Defining functions using recursion also allows properties of those functions to be proved using the simple but powerful technique of induction.

> Defining recursive functions is like riding a bicycle: it looks easy when someone else is doing it.

## Advice on creating recursive functions

1. Define the type
1. Enumerate the cases
1. Define the simple cases
1. Define the other cases
1. Generalise and simplify
