## 4. List Exercises

### 4. Directed Graphs

Create a function `hasPath` that determines if a path from one node to another exists within a *directed* graph.

```hs
hasPath :: [(Int,Int)] -> Int -> Int -> Bool
hasPath [] x y = x == y
hasPath xs x y
  | x == y    = True
  | otherwise =
    let xs' = [ (n,m) | (n,m) <- xs, n /= x ] in
        or [ hasPath xs' m y | (n,m) <- xs, n == x ]
```

## 7. Partial Function Application (Currying)

All of the functions below are equivalent to one another:

```hs
add :: Int -> Int -> Int

add x y = x+y

add x = (\y -> x+y)

add = (\x -> (\y -> x+y))

add = \x y -> x+y
```

## 8. Composisition

```hs
map2D :: (a -> b) -> [[a]] -> [[b]]
map2D = map . map
```

## 9. Folding

Focus on using tail-recursive functions (`foldl`) in order to avoid stackoverflow. However, stuff like `foldr` can be useful to create infinite data types.

> It's `fold` *to the left or right*, not from the left or right.

```hs
length = foldr (const $ (+) 1) 0
map    = foldr ((:) . f) []
```

`const` ignores part of an operation.

The main difference between `foldr` and `foldl` is how the accumulator behaves in the function.

```hs
foldr (\elem acc -> <term>) <start_acc> <list>
foldl (\acc elem -> <term>) <start_acc> <list>
```

[Fold - HaskellWiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Fold)

An example of a Trie (prefix tree):

```hs
data Trie a = Leaf a | Node a [Trie a]
```

We can have 0..N subtrees. Folding the trie &mdash; preorder traversal &mdash;:

```hs
foldtrie :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> Trie a -> b
foldtrie f acc (Leaf x) = f acc x
foldtrie f acc (Node x xs) = foldl f' (f acc x) xs
  where
    f' acc t = foldtrie f acc t
```

## 12. Records

```hs
data Person = Person {
  name :: String,
  age  :: Int
}
-- The name and age function/getters are automatically generated.
-- And they are specific to each constructor

-- Instead of this more illegible version:

data Person = Person String Int
```

## 13. Typeclasses

> Use `:info` on GHCi to get information on each typeclass.

The `MINIMAL` directive describes the minimal set of functions you need to implement in order to make the typeclass work.

By default, `Eq` compares by structure, so comparing Celsius to Fahrenheit will not work if they are part of the same `data` type.

## 17. Monads

```hs
m >>= (\x -> ...)

-- Is equivalent to:

do
  x <- m
  ...

monadd :: (Monad m, Num b) => m b -> m b -> m b
monadd mx my = mx >>= (\x -> my >>= (\y -> return $ x+y))

monadd mx my = do
  x <- mx
  y <- my
  return $ x+y

-- The implementation of the Maybe Monad:

instance Monad Maybe where
  m >>= f = case m of
                 Nothing -> Nothing
                 Just x -> f x
  return v = Just v

--

act >> ...

-- Is equivalent to:

do
  act
  ...
```

### The Monad Laws

1. Left Identity: `return a >>= k = k a`
1. Right Identity: `m >>= return = m`
1. Associativity: `m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h) = (m >>= k) >>= h`

## 18. QuickCheck

Install it with `cabal install QuickCheck`.

```hs
import Test.QuickCheck

prop a b = (a+b) == (b+a) -- run `quickCheck prop` on GHCi

prop xs = not (null xs) ==> (length $ tail xs) == ((length xs) - 1)
-- `quickCheck (verbose prop)` for details.

-- Use `===` to get structural equality not only result equality. (better debugging)
prop xs = not (null xs) ==> (length $ tail xs) === ((length xs) - 1)

-- This will give back statistics on what you wanted to collect.
propRev xs = collect (length xs) $ reverse xs === rev xs

-- Classify a specific use case of testing data
propRev xs = classify (length xs == 0) "empty" $ reverse xs === rev xs

-- Bump up the amount of tests
quickCheck (withMaxSuccess 10000 propRev)

-- Specifying better types so empty tuples don't distort the data for the tests
prop k v m = lookup k ((k,v):m) === Just v
  where types = (k :: Int, v :: Int)
```

QuickCheck is a *checker*, not a *verifier*. It cannot prove correctness.

## Infinite Lists

If you use Fibonacci like this:

```hs
f 0 = 0
f 1 = 1
f n = (f $ n-1) + (f $ n-2)

fibs = map f nat
```

We are going to get O(N^2) because we are not reusing previous results.

This is a much nicer definition:

```hs
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
```

This all could be used to create a lazy, infinite web crawler.

## 20. Advanced Exercises

### 20.1. Infinite Tree with Tuples on Each Node

The tuples correspond to how many left or right turns on the tree structure.

```hs
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)

-- Building the infinite tree:
inv_tup_tree = aux (0,0)
  where
    aux (l,r) = Node (aux $ (l+1,r)) (l,r) (aux $ (l,r+1))

cut :: Integer -> Tree a -> Tree a
cut 0 _ = Leaf
cut n Leaf = Leaf
cut n (Node l v r) = Node (cut (n-1) l) v (cut (n-1) r)
```

### 20.2. Tree Traversal

Write the functions `insert` and `inorder` for the binary tree type. Create a QuickCheck property that checks if the inorder traversal of a tree built with the insert function is sorted.

> Don't forget to use `import Data.List hiding (insert)`

```hs
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)

insert :: (Ord a) => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert v Leaf = Node Leaf v Leaf
insert v (Node l vt r)
  | v <= vt = Node (insert v l) vt r
  | v >  vt = Node l vt (insert v r)

inorder :: Tree a -> [a]
inorder Leaf         = []
inorder (Node l v r) = (inorder l) ++ [v] ++ (inorder r)

prop_IIS xs = sort xs === xs'
  where
    types = xs :: [Int]
    xs'   = inorder $ foldr insert Leaf xs
```

### 20.3. Word Search on a File

```hs
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering -- so the prompt is immediately output
  sws <- getSearchWords
  putStr "File to search: "
  path <- getLine
  text <- readFile path
  let found = findStrings sws text
  let nfound = [ w | w <- sws, not $ w `elem` found ]
  mapM_ (\s -> putStrLn $ "\"" ++ s ++ "\" found") found
  mapM_ (\s -> putStrLn $ "\"" ++ s ++ "\" found") nfound

-- `mapM_` goes through all the elements of the foldable and applies the Monad (IO action)

getSearchWords :: IO [String]
getSearchWords =  do
  putStrLn "Specify the words to search:"
  aux
  where
    aux = do
      putStr "> "
      line <- getLine
      if line == "" then
        return []
      else do
        xs <- aux
        return $ line:xs

lower :: String -> String
lower = map toLower

findStrings :: [String] -> String -> [String]
findStrings sws text = [ w | w <- sws, (lower w) `elem` txtwords ]
  where
    ftext    = filter (\x -> isLetter x || isSpace x) text
    txtwords = map lower $ words ftext
```

## 21. `data`, `type` & `newtype`

1. `data`: new datatypes and constructors
1. `type`: just an alias for a type
1. `newtype`: it's like `data`, but with only one constructor and field.
    - The new type will be isomorphic with its underlying type.
    - New types are checked at compile time, yet ignored at runtime (no work done when pattern matching)

```hs
newtype Name = Name String -- it is like a String, but will be treated as a new type
```

## 22. `Either`

How could we generalize and add polymorphism to `data SomeData = Left Int | Right String`?

```hs
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

type SomeData = Either Int String

[Left 1, Right "Hello"] :: [SomeData]
```

There are 2 interesting functions coming with the `Either` type:

```hs
either :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c
-- Function for right and function for right
f = either (\l -> "Number") (\r -> r)

partitionEithers :: [Either a b] -> ([a], [b])
-- Good for error handling, very similar to `Maybe`
```

## 25. Compiling Binaries

- Your program needs a `main` IO action (`IO ()`).
- `--make` is good practice for resolving dependencies.

[6. Using GHC â€” Glasgow Haskell Compiler 8.4.1 User's Guide](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.4.1/docs/html/users_guide/usage.html)

## 26. Strictness, Thunks & `seq`

```hs
seq :: a -> b -> b
seq a b = b
```

`seq` is the only function that forces the evaluation of `a` before returning `b`. That's enforced in the compiler.

```hs
f $! x = x `seq` f x
```

Returning values in IO actions is kind of useless, so that's where `$!` comes in.

`seq` might throw off some things the compiler expects though.

## 27. Exceptions

```hs
data MyError = ErrorA | Error B deriving Show

instance Exception MyError...
```

**Exceptions may be thrown from purely functional code, but may only be caught within the IO monad.**

```hs
catch :: Exception e => IO a -> (e -> IO a) -> IO a
-- e.g.: `catch ioAction exceptionHandler`
```

```hs
import Control.Exception

data MyError = Error deriving Show

instance Exception MyError

failing :: IO ()
failing = do
  throw Error

main :: IO ()
main = do
  catch failing (\(e :: MyError) -> do -- needs `-XScopedTypeVariables`
    --let t = (e :: MyError)
    putStrLn "Something went wrong!"
  )
```

There are other useful functions, like `catches` and `try`.

Prefer using `Maybe` and `Either`, since the are purely functional. However, exceptions are the only way of dealing with IO exceptions, threads and system management.

## 28. Concurrency & Threads

Haskell 98 doesn't support it.

In Concurrent Haskell, threads are created internally as well, so, from the system's perspective, only a couple threads might be running, when, in fact, Haskell is running thousands in its internal runtime.

So how do you communicate between threads?

```hs
import Control.Concurrent

forkIO :: IO () -> IO ThreadId
-- forkIO act

f :: Int -> Int -> IO ()
f a b = do
  let x = a+b
  putStrLn $! show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  ...
  mVar <- newEmptyMVar
  forkIO $ f 1 2
  result <- takeMVar mVar
  putStrLn $ show result
  ...
```

`MVar`s are mutable locations that can be shared. Actions on `MVar`s are atomic (ACID).

```hs
newEmptyMVar :: IO (MVar a)

newMVar :: a -> IO (MVar a)

takeMVar :: MVar a -> IO a

putMVar :: MVar a -> a -> IO ()
```

**`mVar`'s are still lazy.**

There's also a channel/queue (`chan`) abstraction. You can use channels to send signals between the threads.

> Use the `--threaded` flag on GHC to enable this feature.

Use `mutex` to lock resources.

## 29. Semaphores

This is basically a way of dealing with race conditions when updating, for example an `MVar`.

> Locking synchronization mechanisms: so it might end up in a *deadlock*. This is an open problem, you have to debug and use intuition.

## 30. Software Transactional Memory (STM)

Instead of locking on the acquisition of the data, we check if anything has changed when we are going to finally commit to the storage.

- Critical sections -> Atomic transactions
- If a conflict arises on commit -> Rerun

Ensures atomicity, consistency and isolation. **No deadlocks are possible!**

> This is usually enforced on the hardware level nowadays actually.

This is implemented in GHC through the `STM` (`Control.Monad.STM`) monad, which came up in a paper with Marlow and SPJ.

## 31. Weak Head Normal Form

In Haskell evaluation, we use *outermost reduction* and *sharing* (memoization).

An expression is in normal form if and only if it is fully evaluated. Fully evaluated -> Fully executed. (Beta Reductions in Lambda calculus)

Weak Head Normal Form: (only holds for data values) an expression fully evaluated up to at least the first data constructor. `seq` evaluates to WHNF, for example.

`f x = <expr>` becomes `f = \x -> <expr>`.

> Use `:sprint` to examine this in GHCi.

## 32. `DeepSeq`

[Control.DeepSeq](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/libraries/Control-DeepSeq.html)

If things don't evaluate to normal form and get stuck at WHNF, then use `deepseq`.

## 33. Parallelism

Parallelism != Concurrency

`cabal install parallel` modularizes parallelism.

Take a look at sparks for dealing with parallel computing.

[Control.Parallel.Strategies](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parallel-3.2.2.0/docs/Control-Parallel-Strategies.html)

Be careful with garbage collection though, it might occupy more processing than sparks do.
