# 2. Starting Out

null checks if a list is empty. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. Use this function instead of xs == []

Ranges are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be enumerated. Numbers can be enumerated. One, two, three, four, etc. Characters can also be enumerated. The alphabet is an enumeration of characters from A to Z. Names can't be enumerated. What comes after "John"? I don't know.

```hs
ghci> ['a'..'z']
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

Ranges are cool because you can also specify a step. What if we want all even numbers between 1 and 20? Or every third number between 1 and 20?

It's simply a matter of separating the first two elements with a comma and then specifying what the upper limit is. While pretty smart, ranges with steps aren't as smart as some people expect them to be. You can't do [1,2,4,8,16..100] and expect to get all the powers of 2. Firstly because you can only specify one step. And secondly because some sequences that aren't arithmetic are ambiguous if given only by a few of their first terms.

To make a list with all the numbers from 20 to 1, you can't just do [20..1], you have to do [20,19..1].

Watch out when using floating point numbers in ranges! Because they are not completely precise (by definition), their use in ranges can yield some pretty funky results. 

You can also use ranges to make infinite lists by just not specifying an upper limit. Later we'll go into more detail on infinite lists. For now, let's examine how you would get the first 24 multiples of 13. Sure, you could do [13,26..24*13]. But there's a better way: take 24 [13,26..]. Because Haskell is lazy, it won't try to evaluate the infinite list immediately because it would never finish. It'll wait to see what you want to get out of that infinite lists. And here it sees you just want the first 24 elements and it gladly obliges.

## 2.5. I'm a list comprehension

If you've ever taken a course in mathematics, you've probably run into set comprehensions. They're normally used for building more specific sets out of general sets. A basic comprehension for a set that contains the first ten even natural numbers is set notation. The part before the pipe is called the output function, x is the variable, N is the input set and x <= 10 is the predicate. That means that the set contains the doubles of all natural numbers that satisfy the predicate.

```hs
ghci> [x*2 | x <- [1..10]]  
[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
ghci> [x*2 | x <- [1..10], x*2 >= 12]  
[12,14,16,18,20]
ghci> let nouns = ["hobo","frog","pope"]  
ghci> let adjectives = ["lazy","grouchy","scheming"]  
ghci> [adjective ++ " " ++ noun | adjective <- adjectives, noun <- nouns]  
["lazy hobo","lazy frog","lazy pope","grouchy hobo","grouchy frog",  
"grouchy pope","scheming hobo","scheming frog","scheming pope"]
```

*means that we don't care what we'll draw from the list anyway so instead of writing a variable name that we'll never use, we just write*. This function replaces every element of a list with 1 and then sums that up. This means that the resulting sum will be the length of our list.

```hs
length' xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs]
```

Just a friendly reminder: because strings are lists, we can use list comprehensions to process and produce strings. Here's a function that takes a string and removes everything except uppercase letters from it.

```hs
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']]
```

## 2.6. Tuples

In some ways, tuples are like lists â€” they are a way to store several values into a single value. However, there are a few fundamental differences. A list of numbers is a list of numbers. That's its type and it doesn't matter if it has only one number in it or an infinite amount of numbers. Tuples, however, are used when you know exactly how many values you want to combine and its type depends on how many components it has and the types of the components. They are denoted with parentheses and their components are separated by commas.

Another key difference is that they don't have to be homogenous. Unlike a list, a tuple can contain a combination of several types.

Think about how we'd represent a two-dimensional vector in Haskell. One way would be to use a list. That would kind of work. So what if we wanted to put a couple of vectors in a list to represent points of a shape on a two-dimensional plane? We could do something like [[1,2],[8,11],[4,5]]. The problem with that method is that we could also do stuff like [[1,2],[8,11,5],[4,5]], which Haskell has no problem with since it's still a list of lists with numbers but it kind of doesn't make sense. But a tuple of size two (also called a pair) is its own type, which means that a list can't have a couple of pairs in it and then a triple (a tuple of size three), so let's use that instead. Instead of surrounding the vectors with square brackets, we use parentheses: [(1,2),(8,11),(4,5)].

While there are singleton lists, there's no such thing as a singleton tuple. It doesn't really make much sense when you think about it. A singleton tuple would just be the value it contains and as such would have no benefit to us.

A cool function that produces a list of pairs: zip. It takes two lists and then zips them together into one list by joining the matching elements into pairs. It's a really simple function but it has loads of uses. It's especially useful for when you want to combine two lists in a way or traverse two lists simultaneously.

```hs
ghci> zip [1,2,3,4,5] [5,5,5,5,5]  
[(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)]  
ghci> zip [1 .. 5] ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]  
[(1,"one"),(2,"two"),(3,"three"),(4,"four"),(5,"five")]
```
