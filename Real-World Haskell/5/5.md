# Writing a Library: Working with JSON Data

## A Whirlwind Tour of JSON

- JSON supports four basic types of valueâ€”strings, numbers, Booleans, and a special value named null.
- The language provides two compound types: an array is an ordered sequence of values, and an object is an unordered collection of name/value pairs. The names in an object are always strings; the values in an object or array can be of any type.
