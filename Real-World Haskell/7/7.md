# I/O

- Anything that is type IO something is an I/O action. You can store it and nothing willhappen. I could say writefoo = putStrLn "foo" and nothing happens right then. But ifI later use writefoo in the middle of another I/O action, the writefoo action will beexecuted when its parent action is executed—I/O actions can be glued together to formbigger I/O actions. The () is an empty tuple (pronounced “unit”), indicating that thereis no return value from putStrLn. This is similar to void in Java or C.
    - Produce an effect when performed, but not when evaluated.
    - The type of getLine may look strange to you. It looks like a value, rather than a function.And in fact, that is one way to look at it: getLine is storing an I/O action. When thataction is performed, you get a String. The <- operator is used to “pull out” the resultfrom performing an I/O action and store it in a variable.

- Notice that return call. This is not really the same as return in C or Python. In thoselanguages, return is used to terminate execution of the current function immediately,and to return a value to the caller. In Haskell, return is the opposite of <-. That is,return takes a pure value and wraps it inside IO.
