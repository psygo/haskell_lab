# Efficient File Processing, RegularExpressions, and Filename Matching

- The bytestring library provides a fast, cheap alternative to the String type. Code writ-ten with bytestring can often match or exceed the performance and memory footprintof C, while maintaining Haskell’s expressivity and conciseness.

- We import the ByteString modules using Haskell’s qualified import syntax, the importqualified that we just saw. This lets us refer to a module with a name of our choosing.
    - Whether or not we use qualified imports, we can always use the entire name of a moduleto  identify  something  unambiguously.  Both Data.ByteString.Lazy.length  andL.length, for instance, identify the same function, as do Prelude.sum and sum.

- Other Haskell regexp packages are available for download from Hackage. Some providebetter performance than the current POSIX engine (e.g., regex-tdfa); others providethe Perl-style matching that most programmers are now familiar with (e.g., regex-pcre). All follow the standard API that we have covered in this section.
